We have seen how writing inline comments and roxygen2 function-level documentation within our code can help with improving its readability. 
The purpose of profect-level code documentation is to communicate other important information 
about our analysis (its purpose, dependencies, how to install and run it, etc.) to the people who need it – 
both users and developers.

At this point, the code in your local software project's directory should be as in:

## Why document our code?

Code documentation is often perceived as a thankless and time-consuming task with few tangible benefits and 
is often neglected in research projects. 
However, like testing, documenting our code can help ourselves and others
conduct **better research** and produce **reproducible research**:

- Good documentation captures important methodological details ready for when we come to publish our research 
- Good documentation can help us return to a project seamlessly after time away 
- Documentation can facilitate collaborations by helping us onboard new project members quickly and more easily
- Good documentation can save us time by answering frequently asked questions (FAQs) about our code for us
- Code documentation improves the re-usability of our code. 
  - Good documentation can make our code more understandable and reusable by others, and can bring us some citations
    and credit
  - How-to guides and tutorials ensure that users can install our code independently and make use of its basic features
  - Reference guides and background information can help developers understand our code sufficiently to 
  modify/extend/repurpose it.

## Project-level documentation

In previous episodes we encountered several different forms of in-code documentation aspects, 
including in-line comments and roxygen2 function-level documentation 
These are an excellent way to improve the readability of our code, but by themselves 
are insufficient to ensure that our code is easy to use, understand and modify - 
this requires additional project-level documentation.

Project-level documentation includes various information and metadata about our code such as the legal terms of reusing it, describe its functionality on a high level  and how to install, run and contribute to it.

There are many different types of project-level documentation including.

### Technical documentation

Project-level technical documentation encompasses:

- Tutorials - lessons that guide learners through a series of exercises to build proficiency as using the code  
- How-To Guides - step by step instructions on how to accomplish specific goals using the code.
- Reference - a lookup manual to help users find relevant information about the software e.g. functions and their parameters.
- Explanation - conceptual discussion of the code to help users understand implementation decisions 

### Project metadata files

A common way to to provide project-level documentation is to include various metadata files in the software 
repository together with code.
Many of these files can be described as "social documentation", i.e. they indicate how users should “behave” in relation 
to our project. 
Some common examples of repository metadata files and their role are explained below:

| File            | Description                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| README          | Provides an overview of the project, including installation, usage instructions, dependencies and links to other metadata files and technical documentation (tutorial/how-to/explanation/reference) |
| CONTRIBUTING    | Explains to developers how to contribute code to the project including processes and standards that should be followed                                                                              |
| CODE_OF_CONDUCT | Defines expected standards of conduct when engaging  in a software project                                                                                                                          |
| LICENSE         | Defines the (legal) terms of using, modifying and distributing the code                                                                                                                             |
| CITATION        | Provides instructions on how to cite the code                                                                                                                                                       |
| AUTHORS         | Provides information on who authored the code (can also be included in CITATION)                                                                                                                    |

### Just enough documentation

For many small projects the following three pieces of project-level documentation may be sufficient: README, LICENSE and 
CITATION.
:::

Let’s look at each of these files in turn.

### README file
A README file is the first piece of documentation users are likely to read and should provide sufficient information for users to and developers to get started using your code.   

Let's create a simple README for our repository:
```r
rrtools::use_readme_qmd()
```

NB: the README created by rrtools provides a good template. For the purposes 
of this course we'll create our own.

We can start by adding a one-liner that explains the purpose of our code and who it is for.

``` code
# Spacewalks

## Overview

Spacewalks is a research compendium written in R which contains the data
and code underpinning our analysis of NASA’s extravehicular activity
datasets. It is intended for researchers who want to reproduce our analysis.

```

Now let's add a list of Spacewalks' key features:

``` code

## Features

Key features of Spacewalks:

- Generates a line plot to show the cumulative duration of space walks
  over time
```

Now let's tell users about any pre-requisites required to run the software:

``` code
## Pre-requisites

This research compendium has been developed using the statistical
programming language R. To work with the compendium, you will need
installed on your computer the [R
software](https://cloud.r-project.org/) itself (version: \>=4.3.3) and
optionally [RStudio
Desktop](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).

Additional dependencies are documented in the DESCRIPTION file.
```


:::  challenge

### Spacewalks README

Extend the README for Spacewalks by adding:

1. Installation instructions
2. A simple usage example / instructions

:::  solution

Installation instructions:

NB: In the solution below the back ticks of each code block have been escaped to avoid rendering issues (if you are 
copying and pasting the text, make sure you unescape them).

```text
## Installation instructions

+ Clone the Spacewalks repository to your local machine using Git.
If you don't have Git installed, you can download it from the official Git website.

\`\`\`
git clone https://github.com/your-repository-url/spacewalks.git
cd spacewalks
\`\`\`

+ Open the project in RStudio by clickling on the spacewalks.Rproj file.
+ Navgigate to Build > Check to check the package. 
+ Navigate to Build > Install install the package and restart the R sessions.


## Usage Intructions

### LICENSE file

Copyright allows a creator of work (such as written text, photographs, films, music, software code) to state that 
they own the work they have created. Copyright is automatically implied - even if the creator does not explicitly 
assert it, copyright of the work exists from the moment of creation. A licence is a legal document which sets down 
the terms under which the creator is releasing what they have created for others to use, modify, extend or exploit.

Because any creative work is copyrighted the moment it is created, even without any kind of licence agreement, 
it is important to state the terms under which code can be reused. 
The lack of a licence for your software implies that no one can reuse the software at all - hence it is imperative 
you declare it. A common way to declare your copyright of a piece of software and the license you are 
distributing it under is to include a file called LICENSE in the root directory of your code repository.

There is an optional extra [episode in this course on different open source software licences](../learners/licensing.md) 
that you can choose for your code and that we recommend for further reading. 

:::::: instructor
Make sure to mention the [extra content on different open source software licences](../learners/licensing.md), 
briefly cover it if there is time, then focus on the technicalities of adding a license file to a 
code project / repository (as there is likely not going to be enough time to spend on different license types).
::::::

:::::: callout
#### Tools to help you choose a licence

- A [short intro](../learners/licensing.md) on different open source software licences included as extra content to this course. 
- [The open source guide][opensource-licence-guide] on applying, changing and editing licenses.
- [choosealicense.com][choosealicense] online tool has some great resources to help you choose a license that is
appropriate for your needs, and can even automate adding the LICENSE file to your GitHub code repository.

:::::: challenge

### Change the license of your code

NB: One you've shared your code outside your research group or made your code public it
isn't common to change the license and there are complexities associated with this
(see: [12.2.4 Relicensing Section in R Packages (2e)](https://r-pkgs.org/license.html#relicensing)). This challenge covers the situation prior to code release when you  
might change your mind about the license you'd like to use.

1. Many R packages are licensed using GPL-2 / 3. Read the description of GPL-2 and GPL-3 licenses from the [choosealicense.com][choosealicense] website.

2. Use  usethis::use_gpl_license(version = 3, include_future = TRUE) to change the license of your code to GPL-3. This function will create a LICENSE file in the root of your repository with the text of the GPL-3 license.

::: solution

1. See [choosealicense.com][choosealicense]
2. usethis::use_gpl_license(version = 3, include_future = TRUE)

:::

::::::


### CITATION information

We should add a citation instructions to our README to provide instructions on how to cite our code.
This encourages users to credit us when they make use of our code:

```r
### How to cite

Please cite this compendium as:

> Kopec-Harding et al, (2025). _Compendium of R code and data for an analyis of NASA extravehicular data. Accessed 12 Mar 2025. Online at <https://doi.org/xxx/xxx>
```

In this example, we assume that the code of the R Compendium will be shared online via repository such as Zenodo (see ["Archiving code to Zenodo and obtaining a DOI"]("https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/fair-research-software/10-open-collaboration.html#archiving-code-to-zenodo-and-obtaining-a-doi").


::: callout

### CITATION.cff

We can include citation information in our README file, but there are certain benefits 
to using a a special file format called the [Citation File Format (CFF)][cff], which provides a way to include richer 
metadata about code (or datasets) we want to cite, making it easy for both humans and machines to use this information.

Further information is available from the [Turing Way's guide to software citation][turing-way-citation].
:::


## [Supplementary Material] Documentation tools

Once our project reaches a certain size or level of complexity we may want to add
additional documentation such as a standalone tutorial or “background” explaining our methodological choices.

Once we move beyond using a README as our primary source of documentation, we need to
consider how we will distribute our documentation to our users. Options include:

- A `docs/` folder of Markdown files
- Adding a Wiki to our repository (if sharing online)
- Creating a set of  web pages (either bundled with our project folder or hosted online) for our documentation using a static site generator for our documentation such
  as `pkgdown`.

Creating a static site is a popular solution as it has the key benefit being able to
automatically generate a reference manual from any roxygen2 comment blocks we have added to our code.

### pkgdown [^1]

You can use package pkgdown to create an online site for your documentation. It effectively recycles the documentation you have already created for your functions, information in your README and DESCRIPTION file and presents it in a standardised website form.

Let’s create such a site for our package.

```r
pkgdown::build_site()
```

This creates html documentation for our package in the docs/ folder and presents you with a preview to the site.


::: challenge
### Explore your documentation

Explore documentation in `docs/` folder built with `pkgdown` for your project, starting from the `index.html` file.

Open `index.html` file in a Web browser to see how it renders. 

Check `Reference` page in the top menu to see how roxygen2 blocks from your functions are 
provided here as a reference manual.
:::


::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: callout
### Hosting documentation

We saw how `pkgdown` documentation can be distributed with our
repository and viewed "offline"  using a browser.

We can also make our documentation available as a live website by deploying our
documentation to a hosting service like GitHub pages. You can find out more about how to do this 
here: see [Create documentation site](https://annakrystalli.me/rrresearchACCE20/packaging-functionality.html) in course ["Reproducible Research Data and Project Management in R"](https://annakrystalli.me/rrresearchACCE20/) for further details.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: 


## Documentation guides

Once we start to consider other forms of documentation beyond the README,
we can also increase reusability of our code by ensuring that the content and style of
our documentation matches its purpose.

Documentation guides such as [Write the Docs][write-the-docs], [The Good Docs Project][the-good-docs-project] and the [Diataxis framework][diataxis-framework]
provide a range of resources including documentation templates to help to help us do this.

:::::: discussion

### Spacewalks how-to guide

a. Review the Diataxis guidance page on writing a How-to guide. Identify
three features of an effective how-to guide.

b. Following the Diataxis guidelines, write a how-to guide to show users how to change 
the destination filename for the output CSV dataset generated by the Spacewalks software.

::: spoiler
### Discussion hints & solution

An effective how-to guide should:

+ be goal oriented and focus on action.
+ avoid teaching or explanation
+ use appropriate language e.g. conditional imperatives
+ have an informative title

An example how-to guide for our project to the file `docs/how-to-guides.md`:

```
# How to change the file path of Spacewalk's output dataset

This guide shows you how to set the file path for Spacewalk's output
data set to a location of your choice.

By default, the cleaned data set in CSV format, generated by the Spacewalk software, is saved to the `analysis/data/derived-data`
folder within the working directory with file name `eva-data.csv`.

If you would like to modify the name or location of the output dataset, you should edit
the run_analysis.R script in the `analysis/scripts` folder directly and modify the `output_file` variable.

The specified destination folder `data/clean/` must exist before running spacewalks analysis script.
```

Remember to rebuild your documentation:

```r
devtools::document()
```

directly from the source code.
- Software documentation improves the reusability of research code.
- A (good) README, CITATION entry/file and LICENSE file are the minimum documentation elements required to support reproducible and reusable research code.
- Documentation can be provided to users in a variety of formats including a `docs` folder of Markdown files, 
a repository Wiki and static webpages.
- A static documentation site can be created using the tool `pkgdown`
- Documentation frameworks such as Diataxis provide content and style guidelines that can helps us write high 
quality documentation.
