:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: questions 

- What reproducible research practices have we covered in this course?
- What tools and practices should you learn next?

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: objectives

- Reflect on the reproducible research practices in this course and identify next steps for additional skills

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

In this course we have explored the significance of reproducible research and explored some tools and practices we can use
in our own R development that can help us and others do *better research* including unit testing and dependency management.

Reproducible research often requires that researchers implement new practices and learn new tools - in this course 
we taught you some of these as a starting point but you will discover what works best for yourself, 
your group, community and domain. 

Some of these practices may take a while to implement and may require perseverance, 
others you can start practicing today.

## Next Steps [^1]

In this course we focused on tools and practices relevant to R development. 

A key practice / tool that we did not cover in this course is the use of version control tools 
to track changes in you project. Some of the tools covered in this course e.g. the
`rrtools` compendium will work even better when used with version control tools.

This is an extremely important skill that can help 
support reproducible research - but that's a story for another course.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints

- We covered a range of best practices for reproducible research in this course
- Thes practices will deliver even better results if you pair them with the use of version control 
e.g. git/GitHub.
